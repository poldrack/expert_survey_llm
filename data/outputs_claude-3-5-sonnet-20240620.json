We do\nnot distinguish between these, and you can think of such measures as a\nperformance metric in reaction time, error rate, or both.  \n\nThere are 13 possible responses.\n\nThe first 10 responses are cognitive constructs taken from the \u201ccognitive systems\u201d\ndomain of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain\nCriteria (RDoC), contained in the following python list:\n\nconstructs = [\n    \"Attention\",\n    \"Goal Selection\",\n    \"Updating, Representation, and Maintenance\",\n    \"Response Selection\",\n    \"Inhibition/Suppression\",\n    \"Performance Monitoring\",\n    \"Active Maintenance\",\n    \"Flexible Updating\",\n    \"Limited Capacity\",\n    \"Interference Control\"\n]\n\nPlease respond with a dictionary that includes a key called \"constructs\", \nwhich contains a list of all of the relevant constructs from the list above.\n\nThe dictionary should also contain a key \"measure\" that includes the name of the measure, \nand a key \"task\" that includes the name of the task.\n\nIf you believe that a measure does not map onto any of the constructs, you should respond an empty dictionary.\n\nIf you believe that a measure maps best onto a construct that is not provided on this list, \nyou should respond with a dictionary with the key \"Other:\", containing a description of the construct that best fits the measure.\n\nIf you have additional comments or rationale, please include them in the \"comments\" key of the dictionary.\n \n        This is for the N-back task.\n        \n        The N-back task presents a series of stimuli in sequence. The subject makes a target response if the current stimulus matches the stimulus presented N trials ago, and makes a non-target response if the current stimulus does not match the stimulus presented N trials ago. N can be titrated up or down to increase or decrease difficulty, respectively.\n\n        The measure of interest is: Post-error slowing.\n        "
